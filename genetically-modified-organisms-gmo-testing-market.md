<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymerase Chain Reaction Technology</li><li>Immunoassay Technology</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The GMO testing market consists primarily of two technologies: Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Immunoassay. PCR technology amplifies specific DNA sequences, making it easier to detect genetically modified genes in organisms and food products. It is highly sensitive and can identify low levels of GMOs. Immunoassay technology, on the other hand, uses antigen-antibody reactions to detect GMO proteins in samples. This method is often quicker and more straightforward for routine screening, enabling efficient quality control in the food industry.</p></p>
