<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Immersion Suits Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Insulated Immersion Suits</li><li>Un-Insulated Immersion Suits</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The immersion suits market is segmented into insulated and un-insulated types. Insulated immersion suits are designed to provide thermal protection in cold waters, enhancing survival time by retaining body heat. They incorporate materials that minimize heat loss and are essential for extreme maritime conditions. In contrast, un-insulated immersion suits focus on buoyancy and visibility rather than thermal insulation, making them suitable for warmer environments or specific safety situations where temperature is less of a concern. Both types ensure safety and survival at sea.</p></p>
