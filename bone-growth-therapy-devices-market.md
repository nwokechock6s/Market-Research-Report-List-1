<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Growth Therapy Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Ultrasound</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone Growth Therapy Devices are categorized into three main types based on their mechanism of action. Invasive devices typically involve surgical procedures to stimulate bone healing, often utilizing implants or grafts. Ultrasound devices employ low-intensity pulsed ultrasound to promote bone healing through biological stimulation without surgery. Non-invasive devices, on the other hand, utilize external methods such as electrical stimulation or electromagnetic fields to encourage bone regeneration without the need for surgical intervention, making them safer and more convenient for patients.</p></p>
