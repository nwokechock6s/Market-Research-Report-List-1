<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chancroid Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nucleic Acid Amplification</li><li>Antibody-antigen Test</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Chancroid testing market comprises two main types: Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAAT) and antibody-antigen tests. NAATs detect the genetic material of the causative bacterium, providing high sensitivity and specificity, making them a preferred choice for accurate diagnosis. In contrast, antibody-antigen tests identify antibodies produced in response to the infection, offering quicker results. Both methods are pivotal in diagnosing Chancroid, facilitating timely treatment and control of the spread of this sexually transmitted infection.</p></p>
